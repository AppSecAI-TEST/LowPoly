## LowPoly:A Tool for Generating Low Poly Photo

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-LowPoly-green.svg?style=true)

`LowPoly` is implemented by `JNI`, so it's much faster than other in java.

Like this:

<img src="/art/mooncake.jpg" alt="screenshot" title="screenshot" width="512" height="512" />
<img src="/art/captain.jpg" alt="screenshot" title="screenshot" width="960" height="600" />



## Including in your project

There are two ways:

 1.You can import the module `lowpoly` to your project by Android Studio
  
  
 2.`LowPoly` is available in the MavenCentral, so getting it as simple as adding it as a dependency
 
 ```gradle
 
 compile 'com.uniquestudio:lowpoly:1.0.2'
 
 ```

 
 
## Usage
 
 
 ```java
 Bitmap out = LowPoly.generate(Bitmap bitmap, int gradientThresh);
 ```
 
 Larger the param `gradientThresh` is, more abstract the `out` bitmap is . 
 
## Tips
To avoid out of memory,you can resize the input bitmap using `BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize`
.
